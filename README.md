# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various advanced algorithms and data structures studied in my university course. The code is organized by topic, focusing on specialized areas of algorithmic problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

- **dynamic_programming**: Dynamic programming algorithms from the first semester
- **graphs**: Implementation of graph algorithms including disjoint set implementation
- **lca_rmq**: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm implementation using Range Minimum Query (RMQ) with Euler tour preprocessing
- **range_queries**: Various range query implementations including sqrt decomposition

## Key Implementations
